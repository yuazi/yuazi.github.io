# Audio Reactivity

Audio reactivity is the process of extracting data from an audio signal and mapping it to visual parameters.

## Core Audio Nodes

The basic workflow uses these CHOPs:

1. **Audio File In CHOP:** Brings an audio file (.mp3, .wav) into the network. Or use an **Audio Device In CHOP** for live microphone/line input.
2. **Audio Analyzer comp (tox):** The easiest way to get bass, mid, and high frequency volumes.
3. **Math CHOP:** Scales audio data (which is usually between -1 and 1, or 0 and 1) to the desired range for a visual parameter.

## Processing the Signal

Often, raw audio data is too jittery or "spiky" for smooth visuals. You should smooth the data before mapping it:

- **Filter CHOP:** Adds inertia. Useful to round out hard spikes so motion flows rather than snapping.
- **Lag CHOP:** Limits how fast a value can rise or fall. Great for trailing audio envelopes.
- **Envelope CHOP:** Extracts the overall volume curve of a waveform and drops the fast oscillation underneath it. The result is a clean curve to drive a parameter like scale.
